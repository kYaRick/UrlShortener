# üëã Introduction

"Url shortener" is a file hosting and sharing service powered by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). Users can upload files under 20MB and download hosted files using a "share code" (a short 3 word code provided by [words-aas](https://github.com/chroline/words-aas)). After uploading a file, the file uploader can retrieve the share code and share it with others or delete the file at any time. Files will automatically be deleted after 21 days (WIP).

### üîÑ Changelog

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

# üßë‚Äçüíª Development

1. üìÇ Clone this repo

2. üì¶ Install dependencies with `yarn`

3. üèÉ Start the Vite dev server with `yarn dev`

4. üåé Visit the provided link in your browser

## Firebase

Firebase is used to power the authentication, database, and file storage for URL SHORTENER. For security reasons, the production LIGHTING SHARE Firebase project is not available for local development on `localhost`. As such, you will need to create your own Firebase project for local development purposes.

On your development Firebase project:

1. Enable anonymous authentication.
2. Ensure `localhost` is an authorized domain for authentication.
3. Enable Firestore Database and Storage features.

Replace the `firebaseConfig` variable in `src/util/firebase-config.ts` with the config for your Firebase project.

## Step by step

1. üìÇ Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kYaRick/UrlShortener.git
```

2. üì¶ Install dependencies.

```bash
cd UrlShortener
yarn
```

3. ‚öôÔ∏è Configure the config.js file according to your environment.

    Start node:

```bash
yarn build
yarn dev
```

(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kBs after minification. Consider:
- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
